# Troubleshooting Blank Page Issues

If you're experiencing a blank page when deploying your React application to Vercel, here are the most common causes and solutions.

## Common Causes and Solutions

### 1. Incorrect `homepage` Field in package.json

**Issue**: The `homepage` field in `package.json` is not set correctly, causing assets to be loaded from the wrong path.

**Solution**: Ensure the `homepage` field is set to `"."` in your `package.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "frontend",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "homepage": ".",
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 2. Environment Variables Not Set

**Issue**: Required environment variables are not set in Vercel, causing the application to fail during startup.

**Solution**: 
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
3. Add the required variables:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Set to your backend URL (e.g., `https://youtube-downloader-i1z1.onrender.com`)

### 3. Routing Issues

**Issue**: Client-side routing conflicts with Vercel's routing.

**Solution**: If you're using React Router, make sure your `vercel.json` includes proper routing configuration:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "build"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Build Errors

**Issue**: Errors during the build process that aren't immediately visible.

**Solution**:
1. Check the build logs in your Vercel dashboard
2. Look for any error messages or warnings
3. Fix any issues in your code
4. Redeploy the application

### 5. JavaScript Errors

**Issue**: Runtime JavaScript errors that prevent the app from rendering.

**Solution**:
1. Open your browser's developer tools (F12)
2. Check the Console tab for any error messages
3. Look for network errors in the Network tab
4. Fix the identified issues in your code

### 6. CORS Issues

**Issue**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing errors preventing API calls.

**Solution**:
1. Check the Network tab in developer tools for failed API requests
2. Ensure your backend is configured to allow requests from your frontend domain
3. Verify the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable is set correctly

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open the browser's developer tools and check the Console tab for any error messages.

### 2. Check Network Tab
Look for failed requests in the Network tab, especially API calls to your backend.

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
Make sure all required environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard.

### 4. Check Build Logs
Review the build logs in your Vercel dashboard for any errors during the build process.

### 5. Test Locally
Test your build locally to ensure it works:
```bash
npm run build
npx serve -s build
```

### 6. Redeploy
After making changes, redeploy your application to see if the issue is resolved.

## Additional Tips

### Force Refresh
Sometimes browsers cache old versions of your site. Try:
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try in an incognito/private window
